# Real Time Audio Guitar Effects Using Matlab

An exploring experience of digital signal processing using Matlab software for
the test and creation of guitar audio effects. This is not intended to be a 100%
propietary software. Specialised literature in audio signal processing is used 
and examples are implemented to see how to program real-time DSP applications.
